# LineaMeteoStazione
LineaMeteoStazione is a complete weather station which can be interfaced with professional sensors from Sensirion as well as some Davis Instrument component (Rain Gauge, Anemometer) The project is aimed as DIY weather station but just requiring the assembly part, because the boards will already be given programmed by me as well as the complete PCB. The code and the eagles files will be shared Opensource for the people who wants to try to do it from the beginning or modify it! 

YOU CAN FIND THE WEATHER STATION IN WeatherCloud, Wunderground and LineaMeteo (Italian Weather network!) (Anemometer is not Installed)
